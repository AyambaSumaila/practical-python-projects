Text is a common form of data, and Python comes with many helpful string
methods to process the text stored in string values. You will make use of
indexing, slicing, and string methods in almost every Python program you
write.
The programs you are writing now don’t seem too sophisticated—they
don’t have graphical user interfaces with images and colorful text. So far,
you’re displaying text with print() and letting the user enter text with input().
However, the user can quickly enter large amounts of text through the clipboard. This ability provides a useful avenue for writing programs that manipulate massive amounts of text. These text-based programs might not have
flashy windows or graphics, but they can get a lot of useful work done quickly.
Another way to manipulate large amounts of text is reading and writing
files directly off the hard drive. You’ll learn how to do this with Python in the next chap
